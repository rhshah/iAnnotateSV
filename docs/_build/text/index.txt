iAnnotateSV is a Python library and command-line software toolkit to
annotate and visualize structural variants detected from Next
Generation DNA sequencing data. This works for majority is just a re-
writing of a tool called dRanger_annotate written in matlab by Mike
Lawrence at Broad Institue. But it also has some additional
functionality and control over the annotation w.r.t the what
transcripts to be used for annotation. It is designed for use with
hybrid capture, including both whole-exome and custom target panels,
and short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina.
